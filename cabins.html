		<p class = "cabins-content">
		<!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="EditRegion4" -->We have 7 cabins, all with their own unique rustic character, coupled with all the amenities for comfort. Each cabin has electricity, its own hot water tank, a deck with deck furniture, a propane barbecue, a picnic table and a private fire pit. The kitchens are all equipped with a full size refrigerator, a 4-burner stovetop and/or oven, a microwave, pots and pans, dishes, cutlery, a coffee maker, a hot water kettle, dish soap and tea towels. Each cabin also comes with a bathroom with shower and a wood stove for heating.
			<br>
		Please keep in mind that these cabins are housekeeping cabins. The beds all have bottom sheets on them, but guests are asked to bring the rest of their bedding, pillows, and bath/beach towels. For those unable to do this we have bedding and bath towels here for rent.</p>
			
		
		<p><h2>Cougar Cabin</h2></p>
		<p class = "cabins-content">Our Cougar cabin is popular with small retreats, honeymoon couples, and guests requesting a larger cabin with more room, both inside and out. This cabin boasts a leather sofa, a Lazy-boy soft rocker, a large dining table, 3 sleeping areas, a wrap-around deck and a hot tub open during the low season months. The hot tub is closed during the hotter summer months. The fire pit and picnic area has lots of room, with the grassy meadow surrounding it.</p>

	<p><h2>Lynx Cabin</h2></p>
		<p class = "cabins-content">The Lynx cabin is our newest cabin. This cabin is less rustic than the other cabins and sits in the back meadow area of the resort. It is in a quiet area, is only a short walk to the lake, and you can watch your kids play on the play structure from this cabin. It does not have a view of the lake, but the grassy meadow stretches wide in front of this cabin, making it a great place for family outdoor games. It is also the only cabin with a washing machine inside the cabin.</p>

This cabin is a good choice for families with small children, as it is all one level and the shower has a small built in seat and tub, making it easier for bathing smaller children.</p>

<h2> The Deer Cabin</h2>
					  <p class = "cabins-content">The Deer cabin may be the smallest of our cabins, but it certainly packs a punch in terms of its rustic charm and location. Situated just a stone's throw away from the lake, this cabin is a popular choice among guests who appreciate its log cabin aesthetic and breathtaking views. The large picture window faces East, providing guests with stunning views of the sun rising over the lake and the baby ducklings splashing in the water. The veranda of the Deer cabin is a much-loved spot for enjoying that first morning coffee, surrounded by nature and peace.
