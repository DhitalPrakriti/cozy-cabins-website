            Lakeside Cabin Rentals BC
            Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
            <p>We have 7 cabins, all with their own unique rustic character, coupled with all the amenities for comfort. Each cabin has electricity, its own hot water tank, a deck with deck furniture, a propane barbecue, a picnic table and a private fire pit. The kitchens are all equipped with a full-size refrigerator, a 4-burner stovetop and/or oven, a microwave, pots and pans, dishes, cutlery, a coffee maker, a hot water kettle, dish soap and tea towels. Each cabin also comes with a bathroom with shower and a wood stove for heating.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that these cabins are housekeeping cabins. The beds all have bottom sheets on them, but guests are asked to bring the rest of their bedding, pillows, and bath/beach towels. For those unable to do this, we have bedding and bath towels here for rent</p>

            The Ark Lodge
            Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
            <p>We chose the name "The Ark" for the main house/lodge because every cabin is named after an animal, and the main house sort of looks like an Ark and it suited the name ðŸ™‚ The Ark is more akin to a gorgeous lodge that you would see somewhere in a hunting magazine. It's never been rented before and it sits on top of the hill when you first enter the property. It boasts of over 3500 sq feet with a huge kitchen, family place with the coolest fireplace, and a master bedroom that lets you gaze at the stars while lying in bed.</p>
            <p>Whether you decide to rent this in the summer or winter, your experience will be magical. And since it is significantly larger than a cabin, you can fit two families. Of course, the kitchens and bathrooms are on a whole different level than the cabins. The pictures don't do it justice but at least you can get a good idea. The Ark has its own wood-burning hot tub that isn't shared with any other cabins. And it has a loft with a sectional sofa that you could use as another bed.</p>

            Cougar Cabin
            Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
            <p>Our Cougar cabin is popular with small retreats, honeymoon couples, and guests requesting a larger cabin with more room, both inside and out.

            Lynx Cabin
            Cozy Cabins Wellness Resort | Lumby BC
            <p>The Lynx cabin is our newest cabin. This cabin is less rustic than the other cabins and sits in the back meadow area of the resort. It is in a quiet area, is only a short walk to the lake, and you can watch your kids play on the play structure from this cabin. It does not have a view of the lake, but the grassy meadow stretches wide in front of this cabin, making it a great place for family outdoor games. It is also the only cabin with a washing machine inside the cabin.</p>

            <p>The Elk cabin is one of our most private cabins, sitting in a location overlooking the large meadow, but less than a minute walk to the lake. This cabin is a good choice for families with small children, as it is all one level and the shower has a small built-in seat and tub, making it easier for bathing smaller children.</p>
